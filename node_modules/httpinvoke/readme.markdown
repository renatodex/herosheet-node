# httpinvoke

httpinvoke is a 4.6kb no-dependencies HTTP client library for **browsers** and **Node.js** with a **promise**-based or Node.js-style callback-based API to **progress events**, text and **binary** file **upload** and **download**, request and response headers, status code.

[Ask a question](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6498905)

* Gracefully upgrades to latest platform-specific features:
  * [cross-origin resource sharing](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) - do cross-domain requests with confidence;
  * [progress events](http://www.w3.org/TR/progress-events/) - get current and total bytes downloaded or uploaded;
  * [binary file uploads and downloads](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/) - easily use Blob, FormData, ArrayBuffer, Uint8Array or a simple array of bytes.
* Supports both NodeJS style callbacks and [Promises/A+](http://promisesaplus.com/) (with progress events, see [an example](https://github.com/jakutis/httpinvoke/blob/master/test/promise.js)).
* Supports transparent gzip/deflate content decoding.
* Handles HTTP responses The Right Wayâ„¢:
  * Tries hard to get the HTTP response status code in all cases.
  * Emits the HTTP response status code and headers as soon as they are available.
  * Gives you HTTP status code instead of an error, that is for example HTTP 404 would just return success, with status 404.
  * Throws an error only when the HTTP request did not actually completely finished.
* Well tested - over 277 unit tests.
* Detects the presence of [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/) and [AMD](https://www.google.com/search?q=advanced+module+definition) script loaders.
* Supports [npm](https://npmjs.org/), [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Component](http://component.io/) package managers.
* Tested on these web browsers:
  * Internet Explorer 6 and later;
  * Firefox 1.5 and later;
  * Chrome 1 and later;
  * Safari 4.0 and later;
  * Opera 10.50 and later;
  * Mobile Safari 7.0.0;
  * Kindle 3.0.0;
  * Android 2.3.7.

    if(err) {
        return console.log('Failure', err);
    }
    console.log('Success', body, statusCode, headers);
});

// same as above, but using promise
httpinvoke('http://example.org', 'GET').then(function(res) {
    console.log('Success', res.body, res.statusCode, res.headers);
}, function(err) {
    console.log('Failure', err);
});

// Demonstration of downloading and uploading a file
var converters = {
    'text json': JSON.parse,
    'json text': JSON.stringify
};
httpinvoke('https://bower-component-list.herokuapp.com/', 'GET', {
    outputType: 'json',
    converters: converters
}).then(function(response) {
    console.log('There are ' + response.body.length + ' bower packages.');
    return httpinvoke('http://server.cors-api.appspot.com/server?id=9285649&enable=true&status=200&credentials=false&methods=POST', 'POST', {
        input: response.body,
        inputType: 'json',
        converters: converters
    });
}, function(err) {
    console.log('Error receiving package list', err);
}, function(progress) {
    console.log('Receiving package list progress', progress);
}).then(function(response) {
    console.log('Uploading finished', response);
}, function(err) {
    console.log('Error sending package list', err);
}, function(progress) {
    console.log('Sending package list progress', progress);
});
```

## API

    var abort = httpinvoke(url, method, options, cb)

Any one, two or three arguments can be skipped, except the **url**.

* **abort** is a function for aborting the HTTP request. It is also a [Promise/A+](http://promisesaplus.com/)-compliant promise (has the `then()` method) that receives all the same events as the callbacks - **uploading**, **downloading**, **gotStatus** and **finished** - see [an example](https://github.com/jakutis/httpinvoke/blob/master/test/promiseSpec.js). When invoked as a function, it immediately calls the "finished" callback with an Error. If "finished" callback is already called before the "abort", nothing happens.
* **url** is a string for URL, e.g. `"http://example.org/"`.
* **method** is a string for HTTP method, one of `"HEAD"`, `"GET"`, `"PATCH"`, `"POST"`, `"PUT"`, `"DELETE"`.
* **options** is an object for various options (see the Options section below) or a function, which is used as a "finished" option (see the first example).
* **cb** is a function that is used as an option **finished** (read below).

#### Options

See the Examples section for all the options being used.
All options are optional.

* **timeout** is a number of milliseconds that specifies when **finished** has to be called with an Error if it was not yet called, default is `0`, which means timeout errors are disabled (network stack timeouts result in network errors).
* **uploading** is a function that is called when HTTP request upload progress event happens. It is called with these arguments:
  0. **current** is a number for the number of bytes currently sent;
  0. **total** is a number for the total number of bytes to be sent.
* **downloading** is a function that is called when HTTP response download progress event happens. It is called with these arguments:
  0. **current** is a number for the number of bytes currently received;
  0. **total** is a number for the total number of bytes to be received, or undefined if not known.
* **gotStatus** is a function that is called when HTTP response headers are received. It is called with these arguments:
  0. **status** is a number for an HTTP response status code, either undefined, or a correct value.
  0. **headers** is an object for HTTP response headers. Keys are lower-cased header names, values are strings.
* **finished** is a function that is called when HTTP response is fully downloaded, or any error happens. It is called with these arguments:
  0. **err** is null or an object that is an instance of Error, **please read error conditions section below**;
  0. **output** is:
      * undefined, if err is not null or no response entity has been received (e.g. when **method** is `"HEAD"`),
      * a string, if **outputType** is `"text"`,
      * a bytearray - instance of [Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays/Uint8Array) or instance of [Buffer](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) or instance of [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) that has elements of type "number" with values ranging from `0` to `255` - if **outputType** is `"bytearray"`,
      * any value - if **outputType** is neither `"bytearray"`, nor `"text"`, i.e. a converter has been called.
  0. **status** is:
      * undefined, if err is not null or no correct value is available,
      * otherwise, a number for an HTTP response status code, correct value.
  0. **headers** is:
      * undefined, if err is not null,
      * otherwise, an object for HTTP response headers. Keys are lower-cased header names, values are strings.
* **outputType** is a string for the type of the **output** argument of the **finished** option, one of `"text"` (default), `"bytearray"` or a custom value that has corresponding **converters**.
* **inputType** is a string for the type of the **input** option, one of `"auto"`(default), `"bytearray"`, `"text"` or a custom value that has corresponding **converters**. If not `"auto"`, **input** must be not be undefined.
* **input** must be either one of:
  * undefined (default), if **inputType** is `"auto"` and request **headers** does not have `Content-Type`,
  * a string, if **inputType** is `"text"` or `"auto"`,
  * a bytearray - instance of [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays/ArrayBuffer) or instance of [ArrayBufferView](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays/ArrayBufferView) or instance of [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) or instance of [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) or instance of [Buffer](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) or instance of [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) that has elements of type "number" with values ranging from `0` to `255` - if **inputType** is `"bytearray"` or `"auto"`.
* **headers** is an object for HTTP request headers. Keys are header names, values are strings.
* **converters** is an object to convert custom **inputType** and **outputType** values to `"bytearray"` or `"text"`. Example: `{"json text": JSON.stringify, "text json": JSON.parse}`. If you use custom **inputType**, then there must be at least one converter from that type to `"text"` or `"bytearray"`, and the other way around for **outputType**.
* **corsExposedHeaders** is an array of HTTP response headers to be extracted in **gotStatus** call. Default simple headers like "Content-Type" are always extracted. Applicable only for cross-origin requests.
* **corsCredentials** is a boolean for requesting to send credentials. Applicable only for a cross-origin request. See Feature Flags section. Defaults to `false`.
* **corsOriginHeader** is a string for the request header name for browsers with buggy CORS implementations (e.g. Android Browser 2.3.7) - which do not send the Origin request header in actual request. By default **corsOriginHeader** is not set, as it needs a proper `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` server-side header, see `dummyserver.js` for an example of server-side part of the workaround implementation.

#### Error Conditions

The **finished** callback will be called with an instance of Error only when strictly either one of these things happen:

* **abort** function was called (error message "abort");
* sending request failed (error message "upload error");
* sending request timed out (error message "upload timeout");
* native XMLHttpRequest called .onerror without a .status or .statusText (error message "download error") - this can happen due to various network errors, server response sending errors, or simply an unsupported status code - e.g. Firefox 3.0 ends up here after a status 408 response;
* receiving request timed out (error message "download timeout");
* converter from **converters** option threw an error (the thrown error message is passed);
* request did not even start - calling options validation failed or a feature that is not supported by the platform was used (various error messages are passed, e.g. "Unsupported method TRACE").

So generally, finishing with an error means that a response has not been received.
Please note that a request can finish successfully, with an **err** set to `null`, but also with an undefined **status**, undefined **output** and an empty **headers** object - generally **status** is defined at all times, but some older browsers provide status code only for 2XX responses - e.g. Opera 11.50.

#### Callback Sequence

The callbacks are called in this strict sequence:

0. **uploading** (two or more times);
0. **gotStatus** (one time);
0. **downloading** (two or more times);
0. **finished** (one time), except the case that **finished** can be called with Error any time, and then no callbacks will be called.

There are feature flags to be queried for platform-specific features.
